#### Check if it's online [here](https://calcumlator.herokuapp.com/) or [here](http://armlessjohn404.github.io/calcuMLator/)

I'm hosting the backend of the project at [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/
) with a free plan. It may take a little to fire up the servers there. The page contains more information about the calculator.
