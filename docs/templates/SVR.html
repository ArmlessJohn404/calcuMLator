  <p>The <b>Support Vector Regression</b> utilizes the concept of
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine">support vectors.
  </a> It adds another layer of complexity on top of the <b>Linear Regression</b>,
  which makes it possible to create very complicated curves to fit the data. In
  our case, it approximated the funcions in the range of the training set with
  a high variance. Outside the range of the training set the algorithm predicts 0.</p>
