    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest">Random Forest Regressor
    </a> is another ensemble regressor based on decision trees. It samples a
    random subset of the features for each tree it creates. It's best used
    when there's more features, in our case there's only two.
